# Cerium

Geoclash client written in Rust with the Bevy engine.

### Building

- Download Rust at http://rustup.rs/ or via your prefered package manager
- Download the project with the green button at the top of https://github.com/0HyperCube/cerium. You can use Git or download zip and extract
- Go into the folder you just downloaded.
- Run `cargo run`. This may take about a minute for the first build but subsiquent builds will be quicker.
- You should see a window with FPS and version, the earth model will pop up when the texture has been parsed (may take a second).
